        "Answer": "D",
        "Source": "The occurrence of exotherm is a critical factor for AuNP photoporation because it leads to the formation of vapor nanobubbles (VNBs), which burst and perforate the cell membrane. Therefore, this result confirms that UCNP coating of AuNPs increases the formation of VNBs by increasing the resistive heating losses (RHL) of the AuNPs, ultimately leading to higher UCPPin efficiency."

At AuNP to UCNP ratios of 1:5 and 1:10, the UCPPin efficiency was high with no significant difference in efficiency between these two ratios; however, since processing a small amount is more appropriate than that of a large amount, the 1:5 ratio was used."

        "Source": "An experiment was conducted to verify whether the pulsed wave could be applied to cell spheroids. The 1:5 group showed an efficiency of about 30%, indicating high UCPPin efficiency. It is generally known that as osteoarthritis progresses, the expression level of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 increases. Additionally, IL-6 signaling has been reported to be actively involved in osteoarthritis pathology and to be a factor in cartilage degradation. Therefore, in this study, baricitinib (BRN), an inhibitor of STAT1 and 3 phosphorylation, was used as a therapeutic agent to specifically target STAT-IL-6 signaling."
