        "Source": "Among all radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging, the glucose analogue [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) is the most heavily used to date in oncological applications. However, there are clinical gaps in the effectiveness of [18F]FDG PET, and increasingly, PET tracers targeting very specific molecular and even \u2018druggable\u2019 pathways are required. As a result, there is a great demand for additional radiopharmaceuticals with unique targeting capability for molecular imaging. Recently, a glutamate-based tracer, (S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid ([18F]FSPG), has started to receive great attention as it has been shown to specifically target the cystine/glutamate antiporter (xc\u2212)."
