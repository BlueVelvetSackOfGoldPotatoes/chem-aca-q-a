The intense spectral bands from wavenumbers 1590 cm\u22121 and 1160 cm\u22121 in unmodified bamboo charcoal are engendered by the stretching and bending vibrations of C\u2013H bonds in the methyl (\u2013CH3) groups. However, for the modified bamboo charcoal, the stretching vibrations are significantly reduced, indicating substantial removal of hydrogen."
