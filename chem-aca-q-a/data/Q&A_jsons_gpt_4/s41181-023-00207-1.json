        "Source": "In addition, high uptake was also found in the liver and spleen. Optimal target-to-background ratios are expected 5 h PI. However, the prolonged retention in the liver and spleen even after 23 h PI, could hamper tumor response assessment in these organs. We determined the mean effective dose of [99mTc]Tc-Duramycin as 7.6 \u00b5Sv/MBq, corresponding to a total effective dose of 3.60 mSv for a patient dose of 473 MBq. This value compares favorably to those for other cell death imaging tracers such as [18F]ICMT-11 (12.5 mSv), [18F]CP18 (2.8 mSv), [99mTc]HYNIC-annexin V (5.5 mSv) or [18F]ML-10 (7.7 mSv), and is comparable with the effective dose of [18F]FDG (9.0 mSv) (Challapalli et al. 2013; Doss et al. 2013; Hoglund et al. 2011; Kemerink et al. 2003; Quinn et al. 2016). Moreover, this dosimetry study showed that [99mTc]Tc- Duramycin meets the criteria for radiation exposure specified by the European guide- lines and US Food and Drug Administration. Consistent with the predominant renal excretion of [99mTc]Tc-duramycin, the kid- ney was the dose-limiting organ (23 \u00b5Sv/MBq). Therefore, good hydration and fre- quent bladder voiding are recommended in future patient studies. Another organ receiving a relatively high dose was the heart wall (20 and 44 \u00b5Gy/MBq for SPECT and planar imaging, respectively), reflecting slower blood clearance and high radi- otracer association with plasma proteins, such as lipoproteins that are known to con- tain PE (Zhao et al. 2008). Protein-bound radiotracer is less likely to partition across capillary membranes into tissues when compared with free radiotracer in plasma."
