        "Context": "Isomerism is a concept in organic chemistry where molecules with the same molecular formula have different arrangements of atoms in space.",

    "Question_3": {
        "Context": "Aromatic compounds are a class of compounds that include benzene as a characteristic feature of their structure.",

        "Answer": "D",
        "Source": "Aromatic compounds are characterized by their ring structure, resonance stabilization, and typically nonpolar nature. The presence of a nitrogen atom is not a requirement for a compound to be classified as aromatic."

        "D": "Enantiomeric",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Source": "A chiral molecule is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Such molecules often have a carbon atom with four different substituents, known as a chiral center or stereocenter."

        "A": "Ethanol",
        "B": "Methane",
        "C": "Acetone",
        "D": "Ethane",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Source": "Acetone is a carbonyl compound as it contains a carbonyl group (C=O). Ethanol, methane, and ethane do not contain a carbonyl group and are therefore not classified as carbonyl compounds."

    "Question_6": {
        "Context": "Organic reactions often involve the making and breaking of chemical bonds. A common type of reaction is the substitution reaction.",

    "Question_7": {
        "Context": "Organic molecules can be represented by different types of formulas. One common representation is the structural formula, which shows the arrangement of atoms within the molecule.",
        "Question": "What does a structural formula of an organic molecule typically indicate?",
        "A": "The physical properties of the molecule",
        "B": "The exact mass of the molecule",

        "Answer": "C",
        "Source": "The structural formula of an organic molecule provides information about the arrangement of atoms and the bonds between them. It does not directly indicate the physical properties, exact mass, or energy content of the molecule."
