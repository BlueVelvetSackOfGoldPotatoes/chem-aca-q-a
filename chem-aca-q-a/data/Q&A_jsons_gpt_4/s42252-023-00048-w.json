These biodegradable polymers can be classified as bioderived or fossil-fuel derived, and the environments under which these polymers will biodegrade varies depending on the polymer type, with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) requiring industrial composting conditions above 58 \u00b0C to biodegrade, remaining relatively undegraded for extended periods (years) under ambient conditions in soil or water."
