        "Answer": "B",
        "Source": "The photosynthetic apparatus in the chloroplast is the primary target of heat damage by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing oxidative damage to biomolecules including pigments, proteins, lipids and DNA leading to cellular injuries and cell death. PSII is the most sensitive component of the photosynthetic machinery to excessive ROS damage, thus plants activate photoprotective mechanisms with one of them being upregulation of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) causing depression of PSII activity to avoid damage to PSII reaction centres."
