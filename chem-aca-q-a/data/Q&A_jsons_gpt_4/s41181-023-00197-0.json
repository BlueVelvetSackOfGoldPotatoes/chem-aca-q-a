        "Context": "Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a molecular therapy used to treat certain types of cancer. It involves targeting tumors with molecules that have a high affinity for specific receptors expressed by the tumor cells. These molecules are labeled with a radioactive isotope, which allows for the targeted delivery of radiation to the tumor.",

    "Question_2": {
        "Context": "In radionuclide therapy, the therapeutic index is a measure of the treatment's ability to target diseased cells relative to healthy cells. Alpha emitters are a type of radionuclide that can be used in this therapy and are known for their high linear energy transfer (LET), which is a measure of the energy deposited by radiation into tissue per unit distance traveled.",

        "C": "Because they can induce more DNA damage compared to beta emitters",
        "D": "Because they have a longer half-life than beta emitters",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Source": "Therefore, [225Ac]Ac-DOTA- JR11 can be a potential candidate to improve the treatment of NETs. Alpha emitters showed improvement of the therapeutic index of PRRT due to the high LET offered by the alpha particles compared to beta emitters."

    },
    "Question_4": {
        "Context": "In vitro competitive binding assays are used to determine the binding affinity of a compound to a specific receptor. These assays can be performed using cells that express the receptor of interest, and the binding affinity is often quantified using an IC50 value, which is the concentration of a compound that inhibits 50% of the binding.",
        "Question": "What was the outcome of the in vitro competitive binding assay for natLa-DOTA-JR11 and natLu-DOTA-JR11 in terms of their binding affinity to SSTR2?",

    },
    "Question_6": {
        "Context": "The pharmacokinetics of a radiopharmaceutical can be influenced by the stability of the radiolabeled compound.

    "Question_7": {
        "Context": "The half-life of a radionuclide is an important factor in radionuclide therapy as it influences the duration of radiation exposure to the tumor and healthy tissues. Actinium-225 is an alpha-emitter with a relatively long half-life, which can be advantageous for certain therapeutic applications.",
        "Question": "What is the half-life of actinium-225 and why is it considered advantageous for targeted alpha therapy (TAT)?",

        "D": "30 days, because it ensures complete tumor eradication",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Source": "However, actinium-225 has gained a lot of attention due to its long half-life (t1/2 = 9.92 days) and interesting decay chain offering 4 alpha particles."
    },
    "Question_8": {
        "Context": "In the context of radionuclide therapy, the term 'therapeutic index' refers to the ratio of the therapeutic effect to the toxic effect of a treatment. A higher therapeutic index indicates a greater degree of specificity in targeting tumor cells over healthy cells.",

    "Question_9": {
        "Context": "The kidneys are a critical organ to consider in the biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals due to their role in filtering blood and excreting waste.
