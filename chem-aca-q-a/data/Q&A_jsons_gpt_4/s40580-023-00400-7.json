    "Question_1": {
        "Context": "Amorphous metallic glasses can undergo a phase change to crystalline solids when subjected to high temperatures. However, when local melting is induced by ion irradiation, the resulting thermal spikes can reach temperatures greater than 1000 K without causing this phase change.",
        "Question": "What prevents the phase change from amorphous to crystalline in metallic glasses when local melting is induced by ion irradiation?",
        "A": "The presence of impurities in the metallic glass",
        "B": "The quenching rate of the local melting zone is too slow",
