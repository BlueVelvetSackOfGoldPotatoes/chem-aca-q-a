        "Question": "What is the maximum volume percentage of reinforcement particles typically processed in AMC manufacturing strategies?",

        "B": "30 vol. %",
        "C": "40 vol. %",

        "Source": "Currently, the three main production technologies for manufacturing such AMC are powder metallurgy, semi-solid processes and casting. Here, the AMC\u00b4s reinforcement proportion that can be processed depends on the chosen manufacturing strategy and is therefore often limited to a maximum value of 30 vol. %, due to agglomeration and porosity problems."

In contrast to observed mixing mechanisms, free surface segregation appears in cascading flow regimes, powder flows in avalanches over the free surface and heavier or coarser particles will move further resulting in segregation."
