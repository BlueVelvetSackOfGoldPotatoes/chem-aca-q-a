In this study, we identified GmMYB108 as a potential positive regulator of isoflavonoid production in response to ethephon treatment in soybean. RNA sequencing revealed that ethephon application led to the upregulation of 22 genes related to isoflavonoid biosynthesis in soybean plants. GmMYB108 overexpression resulted in an intense accumulation of anthocyanins and total flavonoids in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Our results suggest that GmMYB108 is a key regulator of flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis in soybean flowers.",

The six treatment combinations included control, 1% MP, 5% FW, 5% biochar, 1% MP + 5% FW, and 1% MP + 5% biochar.

However, the individual and combined effects of FW and biochar on soil properties in microplastic (MP)-contaminated soil–plant systems remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a field experiment to investigate the individual and combined effects of polystyrene MPs, FW, and FW-derived biochar on soil properties and lettuce growth.",

The six treatment combinations included control, 1% MP, 5% FW, 5% biochar, 1% MP + 5% FW, and 1% MP + 5% biochar. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for various parameters including pH, electrical conductivity, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, total exchangeable cations, and soil enzyme activity.",
            "Results": "The addition of MPs did not significantly affect soil pH or electrical conductivity. FW application increased soil pH and electrical conductivity, while biochar application increased soil pH. FW addition resulted in notable increases in available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and total exchangeable cations. Soil enzyme activities were affected by the different treatments, with FW doubling acid phosphatase activity. The relative abundance of certain bacterial phyla was influenced by the treatments.",

            "Abstract": "Traditional autoclaving, slow degradation rate and preservation of biomass treated by fungi are the main factors restricting biological treatment. In our previous studies, strains with high efficiency and selective lignin degradation ability were obtained. To further solve the limiting factors of biological treatment, this paper proposed a composite treatment technology, which could replace autoclaves for fungal treatment and improve the preservation and utilization of fungal-pretreated straw. The autoclaved and expanded buckwheat straw were, respectively, degraded by Irpex lacteus for 14 days (CIL, EIL), followed by ensiling of raw materials (CK) and biodegraded straw of CIL and EIL samples with Lactobacillus plantarum for different days, respectively (CP, CIP, EIP). An expansion led to lactic acid bacteria, mold, and yeast of the samples below the detection line, and aerobic bacteria was significantly reduced, indicating a positive sterilization effect. Expansion before I. lacteus significantly enhanced lignin selective degradation by about 6%, and the absolute content of natural detergent solute was about 5% higher than that of the CIL. Moreover, EIL decreased pH by producing higher organic acids. The combination treatment created favorable conditions for ensiling. During ensiling, EIP silage produced high lactic acid about 26.83 g/kg DM and the highest acetic acid about 22.35 g/kg DM, and the pH value could be stable at 4.50. Expansion before I. lacteus optimized the microbial community for ensiling, resulting in EIP silage co-dominated by Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Weissella, whereas only Lactobacillus was always dominant in CP and CIP silage. Clavispora gradually replaced Irpex in EIP silage, which potentially promoted lactic acid bacteria growth and acetic acid production. In vitro gas production (IVGP) in EIL was increased by 30% relative to CK and was higher than 24% in CIL. The role of expansion was more significant after ensiling, the IVGP in EIP was increased by 22% relative to CP, while that in CIP silage was only increased by 9%. Silage of fungal-treated samples reduced methane emissions by 28% to 31%. The study demonstrated that expansion provides advantages for fungal colonization and delignification, and further improves the microbial community and fermentation quality for silage, enhancing the nutrition and utilization value.",

            "Abstract": "Traditional autoclaving, slow degradation rate and preservation of biomass treated by fungi are the main factors restricting biological treatment. In our previous studies, strains with high efficiency and selective lignin degradation ability were obtained. To further solve the limiting factors of biological treatment, this paper proposed a composite treatment technology, which could replace autoclaves for fungal treatment and improve the preservation and utilization of fungal-pretreated straw. The autoclaved and expanded buckwheat straw were, respectively, degraded by Irpex lacteus for 14 days (CIL, EIL), followed by ensiling of raw materials (CK) and biodegraded straw of CIL and EIL samples with Lactobacillus plantarum for different days, respectively (CP, CIP, EIP). An expansion led to lactic acid bacteria, mold, and yeast of the samples below the detection line, and aerobic bacteria was significantly reduced, indicating a positive sterilization effect. Expansion before I. lacteus significantly enhanced lignin selective degradation by about 6%, and the absolute content of natural detergent solute was about 5% higher than that of the CIL. Moreover, EIL decreased pH by producing higher organic acids. The combination treatment created favorable conditions for ensiling. During ensiling, EIP silage produced high lactic acid about 26.83 g/kg DM and the highest acetic acid about 22.35 g/kg DM, and the pH value could be stable at 4.50. Expansion before I. lacteus optimized the microbial community for ensiling, resulting in EIP silage co-dominated by Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Weissella, whereas only Lactobacillus was always dominant in CP and CIP silage. Clavispora gradually replaced Irpex in EIP silage, which potentially promoted lactic acid bacteria growth and acetic acid production. In vitro gas production (IVGP) in EIL was increased by 30% relative to CK and was higher than 24% in CIL. The role of expansion was more significant after ensiling, the IVGP in EIP was increased by 22% relative to CP, while that in CIP silage was only increased by 9%. Silage of fungal-treated samples reduced methane emissions by 28% to 31%. The study demonstrated that expansion provides advantages for fungal colonization and delignification, and further improves the microbial community and fermentation quality for silage, enhancing the nutrition and utilization value.",

            "Title": "Composite Treatment Technology for Enhancing Biomass Preservation and Utilization",
            "Abstract": "Traditional autoclaving, slow degradation rate and preservation of biomass treated by fungi are the main factors restricting biological treatment. In our previous studies, strains with high efficiency and selective lignin degradation ability were obtained. To further solve the limiting factors of biological treatment, this paper proposed a composite treatment technology, which could replace autoclaves for fungal treatment and improve the preservation and utilization of fungal-pretreated straw. The autoclaved and expanded buckwheat straw were, respectively, degraded by Irpex lacteus for 14 days (CIL, EIL), followed by ensiling of raw materials (CK) and biodegraded straw of CIL and EIL samples with Lactobacillus plantarum for different days, respectively (CP, CIP, EIP). An expansion led to lactic acid bacteria, mold, and yeast of the samples below the detection line, and aerobic bacteria was significantly reduced, indicating a positive sterilization effect. Expansion before I. lacteus significantly enhanced lignin selective degradation by about 6%, and the absolute content of natural detergent solute was about 5% higher than that of the CIL. Moreover, EIL decreased pH by producing higher organic acids. The combination treatment created favorable conditions for ensiling. During ensiling, EIP silage produced high lactic acid about 26.83 g/kg DM and the highest acetic acid about 22.35 g/kg DM, and the pH value could be stable at 4.50. Expansion before I. lacteus optimized the microbial community for ensiling, resulting in EIP silage co-dominated by Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Weissella, whereas only Lactobacillus was always dominant in CP and CIP silage. Clavispora gradually replaced Irpex in EIP silage, which potentially promoted lactic acid bacteria growth and acetic acid production. In vitro gas production (IVGP) in EIL was increased by 30% relative to CK and was higher than 24% in CIL. The role of expansion was more significant after ensiling, the IVGP in EIP was increased by 22% relative to CP, while that in CIP silage was only increased by 9%. Silage of fungal-treated samples reduced methane emissions by 28% to 31%. The study demonstrated that expansion provides advantages for fungal colonization and delignification, and further improves the microbial community and fermentation quality for silage, enhancing the nutrition and utilization value.",

The advancement of innovative miRNA detection technologies can enhance the early detection of malignancies by merging with conventional diagnostic methods, such as ultrasound technology. Herein, we reported a simple, sensitive, and label-free miRNA detection method by integrating the proximity-catalytic hairpin assembly (proximity-CHA) and DNAzyme-assisted signal amplification. Compared with traditional CHA, in which the signal amplification efficiency is greatly limited by the concentration of hairpin probes, the proposed method possesses a greatly improved signal amplification efficiency. The target facilitated the non-enzymatic CHA-driven sequential formation of DNAzyme nanostructures, resulting in the effective DNAzyme-facilitated cleavage of a substrate modified with a fluorophore and quencher, leading to the production of an intensified fluorescence signal. The proximity-CHA-DNAzyme system possesses appealing analytical characteristics, making it highly promising for the analysis of many analytes in clinical research domains.",

The advancement of innovative miRNA detection technologies can enhance the early detection of malignancies by merging with conventional diagnostic methods, such as ultrasound technology. Herein, we reported a simple, sensitive, and label-free miRNA detection method by integrating the proximity-catalytic hairpin assembly (proximity-CHA) and DNAzyme-assisted signal amplification. Compared with traditional CHA, in which the signal amplification efficiency is greatly limited by the concentration of hairpin probes, the proposed method possesses a greatly improved signal amplification efficiency. The target facilitated the non-enzymatic CHA-driven sequential formation of DNAzyme nanostructures, resulting in the effective DNAzyme-facilitated cleavage of a substrate modified with a fluorophore and quencher, leading to the production of an intensified fluorescence signal. The proximity-CHA-DNAzyme system possesses appealing analytical characteristics, making it highly promising for the analysis of many analytes in clinical research domains.",

The advancement of innovative miRNA detection technologies can enhance the early detection of malignancies by merging with conventional diagnostic methods, such as ultrasound technology. Herein, we reported a simple, sensitive, and label-free miRNA detection method by integrating the proximity-catalytic hairpin assembly (proximity-CHA) and DNAzyme-assisted signal amplification. Compared with traditional CHA, in which the signal amplification efficiency is greatly limited by the concentration of hairpin probes, the proposed method possesses a greatly improved signal amplification efficiency. The target facilitated the non-enzymatic CHA-driven sequential formation of DNAzyme nanostructures, resulting in the effective DNAzyme-facilitated cleavage of a substrate modified with a fluorophore and quencher, leading to the production of an intensified fluorescence signal.

            "Abstract": "Plants play an important role in interactions between insect herbivores and their pathogens. The ability of host plants to modify the infectivity of entomopathogens in herbivorous insects has been widely documented. However, the plants’ nutrients have always been neglected as a factor contributing to variation in the susceptibility of insect herbivores to entomopathogens. The fall-webworm (FWW), Hyphantria cunea Drury, is a typical polyphagous caterpillar, and the Hyphantria cunea nucleopolyhedrovirus (HycuNPV) is a distinctly specialized baculovirus for the FWW, which is safe for other organisms and has been effectively used as a biological insecticide against H. cunea in China. In this study, we investigated the nutrient components of four host plant species, i.e., Prunus serrulate, Cerasus serrulate, Camptotheca acuminata, and Populus deltoides, and their effects on the susceptibility of H. cunea larvae to HycuNPV. The HycuNPV-infected larvae fed on P. deltoides leaves exhibited higher survival rates, longer survival times, more food intake, and gained larger body size. These biological parameters were positively correlated with the nitrogen components of host plant leaves. Moreover, the larval antioxidant enzymes exhibited different responses to HycuNPV. HycuNPV infection significantly triggered the catalase (CAT) and prophenoloxidase (PPO) enzyme activity levels of H. cunea larvae. The uninfected larvae fed on poplar leaves induced a robust increase in the POD activity, which could scavenge extra reactive oxygen species and provide a protective effect against the HycuNPV. In conclusion, the plant-mediated effects of HycuNPV on the FWW have been investigated in this study. The nitrogen content in dietary was an essential factor in determining the insect herbivore susceptibility to entomopathogenic viruses, and it helped explain variations in the susceptibility of pests to the entomopathogenic viruses and aid in developing more robust tolerance monitoring assays in the lab that reflect the performance of pests in the field.",

            "Abstract": "Plants play an important role in interactions between insect herbivores and their pathogens. The ability of host plants to modify the infectivity of entomopathogens in herbivorous insects has been widely documented. However, the plants’ nutrients have always been neglected as a factor contributing to variation in the susceptibility of insect herbivores to entomopathogens. The fall-webworm (FWW), Hyphantria cunea Drury, is a typical polyphagous caterpillar, and the Hyphantria cunea nucleopolyhedrovirus (HycuNPV) is a distinctly specialized baculovirus for the FWW, which is safe for other organisms and has been effectively used as a biological insecticide against H. cunea in China. In this study, we investigated the nutrient components of four host plant species, i.e., Prunus serrulate, Cerasus serrulate, Camptotheca acuminata, and Populus deltoides, and their effects on the susceptibility of H. cunea larvae to HycuNPV. The HycuNPV-infected larvae fed on P. deltoides leaves exhibited higher survival rates, longer survival times, more food intake, and gained larger body size. These biological parameters were positively correlated with the nitrogen components of host plant leaves. Moreover, the larval antioxidant enzymes exhibited different responses to HycuNPV. HycuNPV infection significantly triggered the catalase (CAT) and prophenoloxidase (PPO) enzyme activity levels of H. cunea larvae. The uninfected larvae fed on poplar leaves induced a robust increase in the POD activity, which could scavenge extra reactive oxygen species and provide a protective effect against the HycuNPV. In conclusion, the plant-mediated effects of HycuNPV on the FWW have been investigated in this study. The nitrogen content in dietary was an essential factor in determining the insect herbivore susceptibility to entomopathogenic viruses, and it helped explain variations in the susceptibility of pests to the entomopathogenic viruses and aid in developing more robust tolerance monitoring assays in the lab that reflect the performance of pests in the field.",

We observed that HeLa cells grew as spheroids on the OMBTSTS-deposited surface at 20 W plasma power. Res/CD was delivered to the hypoxic core of the spheroid, inducing necrosis, whereas Res was not. Consistently, 10 μM Res alone was not cytotoxic to two-dimensional HeLa cells grown on a culture dish and three-dimensional spheroids. However, Res/CD promoted the necroptosis of spheroids, which were split into small fragments, ultimately inducing cell spheroid death. Collectively, our data suggest that nontoxic levels of Res/CD were efficiently delivered to the hypoxic core of tumor spheroids, promoting cell death. Therefore, Res/CD can be used as an effective anticancer drug. Moreover, the plasma-polymerized OMBTSTS modification technique provides insights into the efficient formation of spheroids in various cancer cell lines.",

            "Abstract": "Pure cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) rapidly degrade in soil, limiting their prospective applications in agriculture. We incorporated lignin into CNFs as an antimicrobial and crosslinking agent to control the biodegradation rate. CNFs with different lignin concentrations were prepared by mechanochemical treatment in the presence of choline chloride-urea deep eutectic solvent. These were characterized using conductometric titration, scanning electron microscopy, and FT-IR. The fibers were applied to soil to determine the effect of lignin on soil respiration and nanocellulose degradation, and were used as a substrate for radish and cress seed germination. Modifying the lignin content of the fibers successfully modulated the biodegradation rate in soil. Fibers containing 35% lignin degraded 5.7% in 14 days, while fibers with 20% lignin degraded 20.8% in 14 days. Nanofiber suspensions showed low chemical inhibition for the germination of radish and cress seeds but higher lignin contents reduced the imbibition rate as a seed coating. This study presents the first use of lignin to control the biodegradation rate of cellulose nanofibers in a one-pot, scalable and sustainable system, allowing the advancement of lignocellulose nanofibers for applications such as seed coatings, mulches, and controlled release fertilizers.",

CNFs with different lignin concentrations were prepared by mechanochemical treatment in the presence of choline chloride-urea deep eutectic solvent.

Novel, eco-friendly and cost-effective nano-enabled fertilizers (NEF) were synthesized using the planetary ball milling procedure. The NEF (nDPF1 and nDPF2) were prepared by impregnation of nanostructured date palm pits (nDPP) with (KH2PO4 + MgO) at 1:1 and 3:1 (w/w) ratios respectively. The nDPP, nDPF1 and nDPF2 were extensively characterized. The produced nano-fertilizers enhanced soil water retention capacity with nDPF2 being the most effective. The water retention capacity of nDPF2 treated soil was 5.6 times higher than that of soil treated with conventional fertilizers. In addition, the nDPF2 exhibited superior sustained lower release rates of P, K and Mg nutrients for longer release periods in comparison with the conventional fertilizers. Findings from FTIR and XPS analyses suggested that hydrogen bonding and ligand exchange were the main interaction mechanisms of PO4-K-Mg ions with nDPP surface. The released kinetics data of the NEF revealed that power function was the best suitable model to describe the kinetics of P, K and Mg release data from NEF in water and soil. Pot study ascertained that the nano-enabled fertilizers (nDPF1 and nDPF2) significantly promoted biomass production and nutrient uptake of maize plants as compared to commercial fertilizer treated plants. The present work demonstrated the potential of NEF to increase nutrients uptake efficiency, mitigate moisture retention problem in arid soils and reduce nutrients loss through leaching and safeguard the environment.",

Novel, eco-friendly and cost-effective nano-enabled fertilizers (NEF) were synthesized using the planetary ball milling procedure. The NEF (nDPF1 and nDPF2) were prepared by impregnation of nanostructured date palm pits (nDPP) with (KH2PO4 + MgO) at 1:1 and 3:1 (w/w) ratios respectively. The nDPP, nDPF1 and nDPF2 were extensively characterized. The produced nano-fertilizers enhanced soil water retention capacity with nDPF2 being the most effective. The water retention capacity of nDPF2 treated soil was 5.6 times higher than that of soil treated with conventional fertilizers. In addition, the nDPF2 exhibited superior sustained lower release rates of P, K and Mg nutrients for longer release periods in comparison with the conventional fertilizers. Findings from FTIR and XPS analyses suggested that hydrogen bonding and ligand exchange were the main interaction mechanisms of PO4-K-Mg ions with nDPP surface. The released kinetics data of the NEF revealed that power function was the best suitable model to describe the kinetics of P, K and Mg release data from NEF in water and soil.

The water retention capacity of nDPF2 treated soil was 5.6 times higher than that of soil treated with conventional fertilizers. In addition, the nDPF2 exhibited superior sustained lower release rates of P, K and Mg nutrients for longer release periods in comparison with the conventional fertilizers. Findings from FTIR and XPS analyses suggested that hydrogen bonding and ligand exchange were the main interaction mechanisms of PO4-K-Mg ions with nDPP surface. The released kinetics data of the NEF revealed that power function was the best suitable model to describe the kinetics of P, K and Mg release data from NEF in water and soil. Pot study ascertained that the nano-enabled fertilizers (nDPF1 and nDPF2) significantly promoted biomass production and nutrient uptake of maize plants as compared to commercial fertilizer treated plants. The present work demonstrated the potential of NEF to increase nutrients uptake efficiency, mitigate moisture retention problem in arid soils and reduce nutrients loss through leaching and safeguard the environment.",

TLLs were initially crosslinked through the Schiff base reaction by oxidized carboxymethyl cellulose (OCMC). The water-soluble OCMC@TLLs complex was subsequently crosslinked by carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCSH) in a microfluidic apparatus to form the CMCHS/OCMC@TLLs microspheres. The CD (Circular Dichroism, CD) and FT-IR (Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, FT-IR) spectra demonstrated that the crosslinking of TLLs with OCMC resulted in a less significant impact on their structure compared to that with glutaraldehyde. CMCHS/OCMC@TLLs showed decreased catalytic performance due to the mass transfer resistance, while its thermal stability was greatly improved. The CMCHS/OCMC@TLLs were used to catalyze the lauroylation of arbutin in tetrahydrofuran. After 12 h of reaction under optimal conditions, the yield of 6'-O-lauryl arbutin reached an impressive 92.12%.

TLLs were initially crosslinked through the Schiff base reaction by oxidized carboxymethyl cellulose (OCMC). The water-soluble OCMC@TLLs complex was subsequently crosslinked by carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCSH) in a microfluidic apparatus to form the CMCHS/OCMC@TLLs microspheres. The CD (Circular Dichroism, CD) and FT-IR (Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, FT-IR) spectra demonstrated that the crosslinking of TLLs with OCMC resulted in a less significant impact on their structure compared to that with glutaraldehyde. CMCHS/OCMC@TLLs showed decreased catalytic performance due to the mass transfer resistance, while its thermal stability was greatly improved. The CMCHS/OCMC@TLLs were used to catalyze the lauroylation of arbutin in tetrahydrofuran. After 12 h of reaction under optimal conditions, the yield of 6'-O-lauryl arbutin reached an impressive 92.12%. The prepared 6'-O-lauryl arbutin has high lipophilicity and exhibits similar tyrosinase inhibitory activity and higher antioxidant activity compared to its parent compound.",

            "Abstract": "The Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLLs) was successfully immobilized within a novel hydrogel matrix through a two-step crosslinking method. TLLs were initially crosslinked through the Schiff base reaction by oxidized carboxymethyl cellulose (OCMC). The water-soluble OCMC@TLLs complex was subsequently crosslinked by carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCSH) in a microfluidic apparatus to form the CMCHS/OCMC@TLLs microspheres. The CD (Circular Dichroism, CD) and FT-IR (Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, FT-IR) spectra demonstrated that the crosslinking of TLLs with OCMC resulted in a less significant impact on their structure compared to that with glutaraldehyde. CMCHS/OCMC@TLLs showed decreased catalytic performance due to the mass transfer resistance, while its thermal stability was greatly improved. The CMCHS/OCMC@TLLs were used to catalyze the lauroylation of arbutin in tetrahydrofuran. After 12 h of reaction under optimal conditions, the yield of 6'-O-lauryl arbutin reached an impressive 92.12%. The prepared 6'-O-lauryl arbutin has high lipophilicity and exhibits similar tyrosinase inhibitory activity and higher antioxidant activity compared to its parent compound.",

The purpose of this study was to analyze the root mycorrhizal colonization process of trifoliate orange and the responsive patterns of plant growth, root peroxide hydrogen (H2O2), antioxidant enzymes and their encoding gene expression, and sugar, lipid and phosphate transporter protein gene expression at 7‒56 days of inoculation (doi) with Funneliformis mosseae (Fm).

            "Abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) trigger beneficial effects on their hosts, but it is unknown how plants modulate their defense responses during root colonization of AMF and the symbiotic benefits are initiated. The purpose of this study was to analyze the root mycorrhizal colonization process of trifoliate orange and the responsive patterns of plant growth, root peroxide hydrogen (H2O2), antioxidant enzymes and their encoding gene expression, and sugar, lipid and phosphate transporter protein gene expression at 7‒56 days of inoculation (doi) with Funneliformis mosseae (Fm). Fm developed appressoriums on the root surface at 7 doi, followed by abundant arbuscules in root cortical cells at 28 doi, intracellular vesicles at 42 doi, and root mycorrhizal colonization rate of 41.54% at 56 doi. Plant growth improvement by Fm started at 28 doi. The immune defense response of roots was initiated at 7 doi, as evidenced by the increase of H2O2 levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) activity, as well as the up‑regulation of PtMn-SOD, PtCu/Zn-SOD, PtPOD, and PtCAT expression, which lasted until 14 doi. Starting at 28 doi, a sugar transporter gene (PtSWEET), a lipid transporter gene (PtSTR), and a phosphate transporter gene (PtPT6) were initiated to be up‑regulated, followed by the up‑regulation of PtSTR2, PtPT3, and PtPT5 at 42 doi and PtFe-SOD at 56 doi. Arbuscule formation and plant growth improvement together at 28 doi suggested that arbuscules trigger improved growth responses of host plants. This study also reveals the initiation of host immune defense response and function in early root AMF colonization.",

The purpose of this study was to analyze the root mycorrhizal colonization process of trifoliate orange and the responsive patterns of plant growth, root peroxide hydrogen (H2O2), antioxidant enzymes and their encoding gene expression, and sugar, lipid and phosphate transporter protein gene expression at 7‒56 days of inoculation (doi) with Funneliformis mosseae (Fm). Fm developed appressoriums on the root surface at 7 doi, followed by abundant arbuscules in root cortical cells at 28 doi, intracellular vesicles at 42 doi, and root mycorrhizal colonization rate of 41.54% at 56 doi. Plant growth improvement by Fm started at 28 doi. The immune defense response of roots was initiated at 7 doi, as evidenced by the increase of H2O2 levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) activity, as well as the up‑regulation of PtMn-SOD, PtCu/Zn-SOD, PtPOD, and PtCAT expression, which lasted until 14 doi. Starting at 28 doi, a sugar transporter gene (PtSWEET), a lipid transporter gene (PtSTR), and a phosphate transporter gene (PtPT6) were initiated to be up‑regulated, followed by the up‑regulation of PtSTR2, PtPT3, and PtPT5 at 42 doi and PtFe-SOD at 56 doi. Arbuscule formation and plant growth improvement together at 28 doi suggested that arbuscules trigger improved growth responses of host plants.

A composite sample of each watery kimchi was prepared for estimation of their bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities. YMK had the highest total carotenoid content (63.78 ± 4.88 mg/100 g, of which lutein, capsanthin, and β-carotene were the main carotenoids), and DC had the lowest (3.50 ± 0.12 mg/100 g). YMK also had the highest contents of chlorophyll (250.1 ± 3.91 mg/100 g), ascorbic acid (447.16 ± 8.95 mg/100 g), and capsaicinoids (2.51 ± 0.09 mg/100 g) compared to DC and NK. The lactic acid content was highest in NK (582.72 ± 29.10 mg/100 g). Moreover, YMK showed significantly higher antioxidant activity (ABTS and DPPH) than DC and NK.

            "Abstract": "Perylenequinones (PQs) from bambusicolous Shiraia fungi serve as excellent photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. However, the lower yield of PQ production in mycelium cultures is an important bottleneck for their clinical application. Light has long been recognized as a pivotal regulatory signal for fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In this study, we explored the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the growth and PQ biosynthesis in mycelium cultures of Shiraia sp. S9 exposed to red light. The continuous irradiation with red light (627 nm, 200 lx) suppressed fungal conidiation, promoted hyphal branching, and elicited a notable increase in PQ accumulation. Red light exposure induced NO generation, peaking to 81.7 μmol/g FW on day 8 of the culture, with the involvement of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)- or nitrate reductase (NR)-dependent pathways. The application of a NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) restored conidiation of Shiraia sp. S9 under red light and stimulated PQ production, which was mitigated upon the introduction of NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO or soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor NS-2028. These results showed that red light-induced NO, as a signaling molecule, was involved in the regulation of growth and PQ production in Shiraia sp. S9 through the NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. While mycelial H2O2 content exhibited no significant alternations, a transient increase of intracellular Ca2+ and extracellular ATP (eATP) content was detected upon exposure to red light. The generation of NO was found to be interdependent on cytosolic Ca2+ and eATP concentration. These signal molecules cooperated synergistically to enhance membrane permeability and elevate the transcript levels of PQ biosynthetic genes in Shiraia sp. S9. Notably, the combined treatment of red light with 5 μM SNP yielded a synergistic effect, resulting in a substantially higher level of hypocrellin A (HA, 254 mg/L), about 3.0-fold over the dark control. Our findings provide valuable insights into the regulation of NO on fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis and present a promising strategy involving the combined elicitation with SNP for enhanced production of photoactive PQs and other valuable secondary metabolites in fungi.",

The continuous irradiation with red light (627 nm, 200 lx) was used to suppress fungal conidiation, promote hyphal branching, and elicit an increase in PQ accumulation. The involvement of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitrate reductase (NR) pathways in NO generation was investigated. The application of a NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO or soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor NS-2028 was used to study the effects on conidiation and PQ production. Intracellular Ca2+ and extracellular ATP (eATP) content were measured to understand their interdependence on NO generation. The synergistic effect of red light and SNP on HA production was evaluated.",
            "Results": "Red light exposure induced NO generation in Shiraia sp. S9, peaking at 81.7 μmol/g FW on day 8 of the culture.

The combined treatment of red light with SNP resulted in a 3.0-fold increase in HA production compared to the dark control.

However, the lower yield of PQ production in mycelium cultures is an important bottleneck for their clinical application. Light has long been recognized as a pivotal regulatory signal for fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In this study, we explored the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the growth and PQ biosynthesis in mycelium cultures of Shiraia sp. S9 exposed to red light. The continuous irradiation with red light (627 nm, 200 lx) suppressed fungal conidiation, promoted hyphal branching, and elicited a notable increase in PQ accumulation.

The application of a NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) restored conidiation of Shiraia sp. S9 under red light and stimulated PQ production, which was mitigated upon the introduction of NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO or soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor NS-2028. These results showed that red light-induced NO, as a signaling molecule, was involved in the regulation of growth and PQ production in Shiraia sp. S9 through the NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. While mycelial H2O2 content exhibited no significant alternations, a transient increase of intracellular Ca2+ and extracellular ATP (eATP) content was detected upon exposure to red light. The generation of NO was found to be interdependent on cytosolic Ca2+ and eATP concentration. These signal molecules cooperated synergistically to enhance membrane permeability and elevate the transcript levels of PQ biosynthetic genes in Shiraia sp. S9. Notably, the combined treatment of red light with 5 μM SNP yielded a synergistic effect, resulting in a substantially higher level of hypocrellin A (HA, 254 mg/L), about 3.0-fold over the dark control.

            "Abstract": "Perylenequinones (PQs) from bambusicolous Shiraia fungi serve as excellent photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. However, the lower yield of PQ production in mycelium cultures is an important bottleneck for their clinical application. Light has long been recognized as a pivotal regulatory signal for fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In this study, we explored the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the growth and PQ biosynthesis in mycelium cultures of Shiraia sp. S9 exposed to red light. The continuous irradiation with red light (627 nm, 200 lx) suppressed fungal conidiation, promoted hyphal branching, and elicited a notable increase in PQ accumulation. Red light exposure induced NO generation, peaking to 81.7 μmol/g FW on day 8 of the culture, with the involvement of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)- or nitrate reductase (NR)-dependent pathways. The application of a NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) restored conidiation of Shiraia sp. S9 under red light and stimulated PQ production, which was mitigated upon the introduction of NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO or soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor NS-2028. These results showed that red light-induced NO, as a signaling molecule, was involved in the regulation of growth and PQ production in Shiraia sp. S9 through the NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. While mycelial H2O2 content exhibited no significant alternations, a transient increase of intracellular Ca2+ and extracellular ATP (eATP) content was detected upon exposure to red light. The generation of NO was found to be interdependent on cytosolic Ca2+ and eATP concentration. These signal molecules cooperated synergistically to enhance membrane permeability and elevate the transcript levels of PQ biosynthetic genes in Shiraia sp. S9. Notably, the combined treatment of red light with 5 μM SNP yielded a synergistic effect, resulting in a substantially higher level of hypocrellin A (HA, 254 mg/L), about 3.0-fold over the dark control. Our findings provide valuable insights into the regulation of NO on fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis and present a promising strategy involving the combined elicitation with SNP for enhanced production of photoactive PQs and other valuable secondary metabolites in fungi.",

The content of hydrogen peroxide produced by CTs was increased in P. pentosaceus SF11, and antibacterial activity partly occurred due to this hydrogen peroxide.

The content of hydrogen peroxide produced by CTs was increased in P. pentosaceus SF11, and antibacterial activity partly occurred due to this hydrogen peroxide. The global transcriptome analysis showed that CTs upregulated the expression of 187 genes, most of which were involved in hypothetical protein, followed by the PTS (phosphotransferase system) system, while three genes were involved in oxidative stress.",

Nicotiana glauca, a non-food crop, was studied for its biomass potential and metabolite content. Sequential solvent extractions were applied to N. glauca leaves to enrich extracts containing various metabolites. The enriched fractions revealed high levels of hydrocarbons, oils, and co-products. Saccharification yield and cell wall composition analyses showed the potential of N. glauca as a lignocellulosic substrate for fermentable sugars production.

            "Methods": "The study involved continuous operation of two parallel plug-flow reactors equipped with on-line sensors for pH-value, conductivity, and ORP. The process performance was evaluated by measuring metabolites and the physiological state of the mixed culture. Data evaluation and correlation analysis were conducted to identify relationships between on-line parameters and process performance.",
            "Results": "The study identified correlations between on-line measurements and acidogenesis, with the ORP measurement at the inlet showing direct correlations with acidification, butyric acid, and lactic acid concentrations. The on-line monitoring of conductivity at the outlet was found to be a reliable indicator for the accumulation of total short-chain carboxylic acids (SCCAs) in the PFR during dynamic operation conditions.",
            "Experiment details": "The experiment involved variations in hydraulic retention time, recirculation, and bioaugmentation while keeping the feedstock composition constant. The study demonstrated the robustness of on-line monitoring for detecting fermentation patterns and acid concentrations under changing process conditions."
