        "Context": "The study evaluated the effectiveness of Ceramic hydroxyapatite (CHT) as a polishing step for bsAb purification. The results showed superior aggregate removal by CHT compared to Cation exchange chromatography (CEX).",
        "Question": "What was the main advantage of using Ceramic hydroxyapatite (CHT) over Cation exchange chromatography (CEX) for bsAb purification?",
        "A": "Higher process-related impurity removal",
        "B": "Lower product purity",
        "C": "Reduced chromatography-induced aggregation",
        "D": "Increased HMW impurities",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Source": "CHT chromatography proved to offer better aggregate removal than CEX for all three tested bsAbs (Molecules A, B, and C), and CHT-NaCl showed the best performance. 'Chromatography-induced aggregation' was rarely detected in post-CHT products, especially in CHT-NaCl runs."

        "A": "CHT-NaCl",
        "B": "CHT-P",
        "C": "CEX",
        "D": "Both CHT-NaCl and CHT-P",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Source": "For Molecules A and B, CHT-NaCl significantly outperformed CHT-P, as evidenced by approximately threefold less HMWs detected in post CHT-NaCl product. However, CHT-P showed almost equivalent HMW removal efficiency to CHT-NaCl for Molecule C."

    "Question_3": {
        "Context": "The study explored the binding preferences of different protein domains to the Ceramic hydroxyapatite (CHT) binding sites.",
        "Question": "Which domain composition of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) showed a higher binding preference to the C-sites on CHT?",
        "A": "scFv",

        "C": "Fc (knob)",
        "D": "Fc (hole)",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Source": "Fc domains (Fc (knob), Fc (hole), and Fc (wild type)) owned higher C-site binding ratios than both scFv and Fab domains. Hence, Fc domains would favourably bind to C-sites, while binding of both scFv and Fab had higher tendency towards P-sites."

        "Answer": "B",
        "Source": "For Molecules A and B, better large LMW removal by CHT-P could be simply explained by the different C-site cooperation during CHT-NaCl and CHT-P elution. Better separation resolution by CHT-P suggested that monomers and large LMW impurities expressed divergent binding preference to CHT binding sites, where ones could be more favoured to C-sites than the others."
