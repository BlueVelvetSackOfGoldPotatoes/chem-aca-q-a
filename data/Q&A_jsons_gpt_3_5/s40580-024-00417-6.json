        "Answer": "D",
        "Source": "Although material descriptors vary in complexity, they must all satisfy the four characteristics below. (1) Reproducibility means that where the same descriptors are used, the descriptors should be fixed for the same material at any time and place to guarantee the repeatability of machine learning results. (2) Validity means that the descriptor should describe at least one intrinsic property of the material that is strongly relevant to the purpose of the machine learning. (3) Distinguishability means that differences between the descriptors of different materials can be recognized by the machine. (4) Simplicity means that descriptors cannot be too complex to be learned or understood by machines."
