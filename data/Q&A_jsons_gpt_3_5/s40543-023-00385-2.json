    "Question_1": {
        "Context": "The study involved a pretreatment process to analyze sulfur isotope compositions of sulfide minerals from metallic ore deposits.

        "A": "Pyrite and galena have different sulfur isotope compositions.",

        "Answer": "D",
        "Source": "The sulfur isotope value of barite (av. 5.9\u2030), the product, was lower than that of sulfides (av. 6.9\u2030), the reactant; this seems to be attributed to the fact that sulfur from galena was extracted from the sulfide mixture at an early stage and it fractionated preferentially with a low isotope value during the H2S-forming process."
