        "Source": "The synthesis of polysaccharides is notoriously difficult, due to the challenges related to regio- and stereo-selectivity, which often require laborious protection/deprotection strategies. This is especially troublesome in the synthesis of glycan-based positron emission tomography (PET) tracers bearing short-lived isotopes, where the radiolabelling should be performed ideally as the final step, and any subsequent conversion should be avoided. Realizing the efficiency and selectivity of chemoenzymatic approaches, the group of Wilson employed a series of disaccharide phosphorylases for the conversion of [18F] fluoro-deoxyglucose ([18F]FDG), the most commonly used clinical PET tracer, into disaccharides."
