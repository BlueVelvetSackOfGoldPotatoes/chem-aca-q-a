    "Question_4": {
        "Context": "The bleaching of Chemi-Thermo-Mechanical Pulp (CTMP) results in a whiter pulp, but it cannot achieve the same level of whiteness as kraft pulps due to the high amount of lignin maintained in the CTMP process.",

        "Answer": "B",
        "Source": "The variation of K between 0.8 and 0.9 shows bigger modifications in the slope as we observe a similar slope to the control for lower aw. However, when aw is higher than 0.6, we can observe that the slope with K = 0.9 diverges from the control and results in a higher water uptake (39% at 1 compared to 25% for the control slope). This variable translates the behavior of the water multilayer on the cellulose fibers surface."
