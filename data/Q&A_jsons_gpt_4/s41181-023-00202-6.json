        "Context": "Macrocyclic ligands are known for their ability to form stable complexes with metal ions. The concept of a 'macrocyclic cavity' has been used to explain the high selectivity of these ligands for certain metal ions.",
        "Question": "What is the hypothesized reason for the high selectivity of macrocyclic ligands like crown ethers for alkali metal ions?",
        "A": "The formation of strong covalent bonds",
        "B": "The presence of a macrocyclic cavity that matches the size of the ion",
        "C": "The high ionic charge of the metal ions",
        "D": "The presence of delocalized electrons in the ligand",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Source": "Since the outer electron distribution of an alkali metal ion always overlaps that of the noble gas that precedes it in the periodic table, the inherent inertness of this closed-shell electronic configuration prevents the formation of strong covalent bonds between the ligand and the cation. Therefore, to account for the high selectivity of crown ethers for alkali metal ions the model of \u2018macrocyclic cavity\u2019 was introduced."

        "A": "Its atomic number",
        "B": "Its covalent radius",
        "C": "Its volume calculated from the value of its ionic radius",
        "D": "Its electron configuration",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Source": "In this example, the size of the cation is simply interpreted as its volume calculated from the value of its ionic radius, whereas the size of the macrocyclic cavity is conventionally determined by considering the bond distances of the main atoms surrounding the cavity and drawing its boundaries, as measured from X-ray diffraction data."

        "D": "Decrease in the reaction's free energy",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Source": "The 'macrocyclic chelate effect' refers to the increase in thermodynamic stabilization of the metal complex when n monodentate ligands are replaced by a macrocyclic ligand containing the same n coordinating atoms connected in a ring. It is considered essentially an entropic effect generated by the decrease of free energy of the reaction of complex formation between the metal and the macrocycle brought about by the concomitant decrease of the entropy of reaction."

        "Answer": "C",
        "Source": "The need to distort the structure of the DOTA ligand is also revealed by the fact that radiolabeling reactions always requires heating to obtain a satisfactory radiochemical yield. If analyzed together, these observations lead to the conclusion that it is not scientifically justified to assume that in complexes with the DOTA ligand it is the metal that must adapt to the conformation of the hypothetical macrocyclic cavity, but rather the exact opposite occurs, and it is the DOTA ligand that undergoes a rearrangement to meet the electronic requirements of the metal."
