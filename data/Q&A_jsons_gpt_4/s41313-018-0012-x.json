        "Context": "In systems of conservation laws, defects can arise and affect the system's behavior. These defects can be non-smooth and are a challenge to both theory and practical applications.",

        "A": "They tend to produce smooth and predictable outcomes.",
        "B": "They tend to give way to non-smooth defects after only finite time.",
        "C": "They are only applicable to hydrodynamic systems.",

        "Source": "In the presence of discontinuities in u, the derivatives appearing in Eqs. (1-2) are no longer well defined, and so we must generalize our notion of 'solution' to a PDE in order to make sense of the conservation law at later times. Such a generalization is referred to as a weak solution."

    "Question_3": {
        "Context": "In the study of conservation laws, entropy conditions are used as a way to impose additional conditions on the solution to obtain uniqueness.",

        "Source": "The Rankine-Hugoniot relation is a statement of conservation of mass across a shock. For the case of a regular shock in one spatial dimension which moves with speed \u03c3, mass conservation requires that the net flux into the shock balance the mass of the 'hole' left as the shock moves away."

        "C": "The mass of the delta shock is added to the conservation equation.",
        "D": "The flux function is removed from the equation.",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Source": "If we allow the possibility of delta shocks storing mass on the defect, it is now the combination of the hole behind the shock and the mass m of the delta which must balance the incoming flux. The modified Rankine-Hugoniot relation is thus F(ul) \u2212 F(ur) = \u03c3 (ul \u2212 ur) + dm/dt."

        "C": "It ensures that the defect will dissipate over time.",
        "D": "It has no effect on the behavior of the defect.",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Source": "We can also produce a similar effect even in scalar conservation laws by insisting that a defect move according to specified kinematics which are not compatible with the flow of the scalar conserved quantity. The simplest such example is to demand that a defect be stationary."

This information is usually specified as a relationship between the values of the solution u on either side of a defect; when the relationship takes the form of an inequality it is called an entropy condition."
