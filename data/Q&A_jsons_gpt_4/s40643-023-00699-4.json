        "Source": "The continuous discharge causes nutrient accumulation in water bodies such as the sea, lake, and river, which in turn results in rapidly growing nutrients plants on the surface of the water (algal bloom). The algal bloom blocks sunlight from the waterbed plant life. Because of the dead algal blooms, oxygen is reduced in the water, and microorganisms, which use up any remaining oxygen within the water, break down the dead plant matter. Finally, all animal life dies due to the lack of oxygen in the water environment."
