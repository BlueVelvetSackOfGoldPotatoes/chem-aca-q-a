    "Question_9": {
        "Context": "Radiopharmaceuticals require a unique approach to manufacturing due to the nature of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.",
        "Question": "Why is the classical pharmaceutical approach of separate manufacturing of a drug substance and a drug product hardly possible for radiopharmaceuticals?",
