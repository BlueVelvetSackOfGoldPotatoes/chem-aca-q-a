        "Context": "In anaerobic digestion, hydrolysis and acidogenesis are often spatially separated from methanogenesis to improve the digestion of residual biomass.",

        "C": "Increased hydrolysis of recalcitrant biomass under certain conditions",
        "D": "Decreased overall yield of the digestion process",
        "Answer": "D",
        "Source": "The two-stage setup holds various advantages depending on the feedstock: (i) a fast acidification of the methanogenesis is prevented in case of a sudden increase of easily degradable matter (e.g., food waste), (ii) the detoxification of inhibiting biomass such as citrus waste (Lukitawesa et al. 2018) or inhibitors from thermal pretreatment (Li et al. 2017); (iii) increased hydrolysis of recalcitrant biomass in the first stage under certain process conditions (e.g., acidic or alkaline pH-value) other than optimal for full digestion (Voelklein et al. 2016; Cheah et al. 2019), (iv) thermophilic pre-digestion (Garcia-Aguirre et al. 2017; Qin et al. 2017), respectively."

        "Answer": "B",
        "Source": "In plug-flow reactors (PFRs) with laminar flow, mixing occurs in radial direction more or less exclusively. As a result, if there is sufficient hydrolytic and acidogenic activity among the microbial population, gradients should appear among the pH-value, ORP and conductivity."

        "Answer": "D",
        "Source": "In particular, changes of the feedstock composition, the SCCA composition and bioaugmentation were found to influence the spatial gradient development in the PFRs. In contrast, variation of the HRT or thin-sludge recirculation did not provoke significant changes in the gradient formation."

This process leads to an enlargement of the surface area and higher porosity, which subsequently exposes hemicellulose and cellulose to enzymatic degradation (Peng et al. 2019; Ma et al. 2021)."
